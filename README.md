📈 Time Series Forecasting of Ethereum (ETH/USDT) with ARIMA
🔬 Analyzing and predicting crypto market trends using statistical modeling

🧠 Project Summary
In this project, I performed a time series analysis on Ethereum’s (ETH/USDT) historical price data to forecast future values using the ARIMA model. This analysis showcases how traditional statistical methods can be applied to volatile and high-frequency financial markets like cryptocurrency.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)

Data Source: Kaggle (Ethereum & USDT historical price data)

🔍 Workflow Overview
Data Acquisition
Downloaded and merged ETH and USDT price datasets from Kaggle.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized price trends, seasonality, and volatility using plots.

Data Preprocessing
Converted the price series into a stationary form (using differencing and ADF test).

Model Building
Selected optimal parameters (p, d, q) for ARIMA using AIC and BIC.

Forecasting & Evaluation
Predicted future Ethereum prices and compared model performance using RMSE and MAPE.

📊 Key Outcomes
Built an interpretable forecasting model using ARIMA.

Gained valuable insights into Ethereum price dynamics.

Demonstrated the application of statistical modeling in real-world financial scenarios.
